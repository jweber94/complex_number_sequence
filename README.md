# Project: Calculate the convergence radius of complex number sequences
This project is based on the homework of the KIT lecture "Wissenschaftliches Programmieren f√ºr Ingenieure" in the WS 18/19. The aim of the homework was to show of object oriented programming, especially the operator overloading principle. Therefore, an own implementation of a complex number datatype _MyComplex_ was implemented. (If I need to use a complex number in a real world project, of course I would use math library like cmath or eigen.)
After implementing a proper complex number class, the calculation of the a complex number set (called "mandelbrot set" (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot-Menge)) is implemented in the main with the help of the functions in _mandelbrot_utils_. 
To make the calculation a little more interesting, we analyze three different complex number sets. These are the following: 
+ $(z_i+1 = z_i^2 + c), with $(c = const)
+ $(z_i+1 = z_i^2 + c), with $(c = n_x*delta_x + i*n_y*delta_y)
+ $(z_i+1 = z_i^4 + c), with $(c = c = n_x*delta_x + i*n_y*delta_y)

# Usage
To make the code run on all machines and OS, I created a _Dockerfile_ to create a Docker Image/Container to run the code within a Ubuntu 18.04 emulation. 
In order to make it run, you have to build the docker (this might take a while): 
    $ docker build -t "test:mandelbrot_image" .
Then you can start the docker continer with a terminal: 
    $ docker run -it --name mandelbrot_container -v /path/to/your/local/ipoque_wipro/results:/mandelbrot_project/my_code/results test:mandelbrot_image /bin/bash
To go in the container with a second terminal
    $ docker exec -it mandelbrot_container /bin/bash
Now you are in the docker within the repository folder. You forwarded the folder /path/to/your/desired/results/dir from your local OS installation to the docker so that you write the result files to you local machine if the use the -v (--volume) flag.

Now you are able to run the code. In /mandelbrot_project/my_code/build you can find the _run_mandelbrot_ executable. If you execute it, you will get asked to provide a config file. You can find a reference for the structure and three examples of config-files in the folder /etc. You can choose one of by giving them the relative path.(eg. ../etc/mandelbrot_condig_case_1.yml) After the execution, there will be result-files in the /build folder. These will read in to the python plot scripts. 

To run the python plot-scripts, go to the folder /scripts. With the execution of 
    # ./plot_mandelbrot.py --file /path/to/result.dat --result /path/to/save/image.jpeg
a plot of the complex convergency will be saved in /path/to/save/image.jpeg. To know more about the plot script, type
    # ./plot_mandelbrot.py --help
Example: 
    # ./plot_mandelbrot.py --path ../build/ergebnis1A.dat --result ../results/ergebnis1A.jpeg
You can also use the gnuplot script _plot_result.gp_ by using:
    # gnuplot plot_result.gp
Prerequisite for this is the naming convention of the result files (for more information, look into the .gp script) and they must be in the same folder as the plot_result.gp script. 

To access the result images from outside the docker container, you have to copy the _nameImage.jpeg_ data within the docker container to the directory _results_ (which is at the beginning an empty folder).  

# Possible next steps for the project
These are possible next steps for the mini-project. There was not enough time to do this in Order to hand you a little code project in. I would like to do/rework the followning things: 
+ Define a Linting-Standart (e.g with clang-tidy) and rework the code based on it
+ Include Unit-Testing for the operators of MyComplex to make the code more trustworthy if you change basic functionallitiys
+ Include doxygen
+ Create a gitlab CI/CD or Github-Actions Pipeline for Unit-Testing, Linting and create the documentation automatically
+ Think about parallelizing the calculation with threads or openMP
